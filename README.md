# OpenGL-Rust

This project is a basic OpenGL learning playground written in Rust. It uses the [SDL2](https://crates.io/crates/sdl2) and [gl](https://crates.io/crates/gl) crates to create a window and render with OpenGL. The goal is to follow and experiment with various OpenGL tutorials, translating them into Rust for learning and practice.

## Features

- SDL2 window and event handling
- OpenGL context creation
- Basic rendering loop

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vankata03/OpenGL-Rust.git
```

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable, [install here](https://rustup.rs/))
- SDL2 library installed on your system
  - On macOS: `brew install sdl2`
  - On Linux: `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev`
  - On Windows: [SDL2 downloads](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)

### Build and Run

```sh
cargo run
```
